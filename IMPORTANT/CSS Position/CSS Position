Realtive means the element which has property Position:realtive
=>The element move respect to his current position which we define by top,left,etc
=>Any element we are giving position realtive it will definetly move from 
his position but it( will occupy also ) it will not let anyone come to his
position

=>So if div has position Absolute it will search for parent that 
if paren has position Absolute then it will take that refernce
otherwise it will go for parent's parent that is body still no position given
then it will act from that position
