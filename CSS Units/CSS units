4.)Px   (1 inch =96px)
5.)Pt   (1 inch =72pt)
6.)Pc   (1pc = 12pt)

b)Relative in CSS

1.)Em =>em is relative to the size of its direct parent
=>If we give em 1 then it is equal to parent
=>If we give em 2 then it will multiply to parent
eg:-parent = 4 then em will be 8 if we want to half wrt to parent
then we have to multiply by 0.5

2.)Rem => rem is only relative to root(html tag) size
=>if we dont give style to html tag dont think that there is no style
=>Browser will assign if we dont assign it   

3.)Vh => 1% of view port height
4.)Vw => 1% of view port width

5.)% => relative to parent
